    Separate 
      - better program security we can terminate the program 
          - when it goes out of it's instruction memory space, we can prevent rogue programs from
          interpreting random memory as their instructions.
          - we can prevent programs from self modifying.
      - safer as we won't be able accidentally modify our own program.
    Same
      - can use instructions as data

    clarvi doesn't have any caches so having multiple CPUs would oversaturate the memory bus, and
    most cpus would spend their time idling.
